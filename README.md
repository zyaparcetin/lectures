## Getting started  
&nbsp;
- ### PLANTUML
  &nbsp;
  > **Note:**  
    > - There is a **class.puml** example file located in the **_architecture_** folder.  
  &nbsp;
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  To start working **_*.puml_** files:  
  
  - You can continue by editing the **class.puml** file   
  - Add additional **_*.puml_** files on that folder too.  
  &nbsp;  

  If you what to visualize a preview of the **class.puml** file or another **_*.puml_** file on the project, please select the file and on your keyboard press the following keys:
  <p>&nbsp;</p>  

  - _MacOS_: **Option + D**  
  
  - _Linux/Windows_: **Alt + D**  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  The above commands will automatically open your a window and will show you live any updates that you make on the file.    
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 

- ### NODE / JS  
  &nbsp; 
  > **Note:**
    >-  _There is an **index.js** file located under the **_src_** folder_  
    >-  _The **index.js** file, it's already linked with the debugger in your **launch.json**_  
  &nbsp;   
  <p>&nbsp;</p>  

  To run the **index.js** file:
    <p>&nbsp;</p> 

    - with **_node_**, copy and enter one of the following commands on your terminal:

      ```sh
      npm start
      ```
      or:

      ```sh
      node src/index.js
      ```
    <p>&nbsp;</p>  

    - with **_nodemon_**, copy and enter one of the following commands on your terminal:

      ```sh
      npm run dev
      ```
      or:

      ```sh
      nodemon src/index.js
      ```
